# NeuralX TrustNet  
### Preventive Trust Layer for the AI Internet

NeuralX TrustNet is a multi-modal AI system designed to **detect and prevent AI-generated fake content before it spreads**.  
Unlike traditional moderation tools, NeuralX operates as an **infrastructure-level trust layer** for platforms.
